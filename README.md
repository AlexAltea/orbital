## FAQ

> Where can I get Orbital?

**This project is not ready for end users.** No binaries are provided, so you must build each of the three components (BIOS, GRUB, QEMU) yourself. Furthermore, configuring the emulator to do something will be hard, as you will need to extract your own console keys. More information and guides on this matter will be available in the future.

## Requirements

* __System__: Windows (7+), Linux (4.4+), macOS (10.10+).
* __Processor__: x86-64 CPU with AVX/BMI1 and virtualization extensions.
* __Memory__: 12 GB RAM.
* __Graphics__:  GPU with software support for Vulkan 1.0+.
